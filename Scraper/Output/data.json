Currently the team has deep experience in sports science and biomechanics. The program is currently offered online through the sponsorship of ActiveSG initiatives. Refer to link below. We had a trial run on a group of community volunteers. The positive feedback was the ease of exercise and applicable to their fall awareness and prevention.

Initially, the Nicholson Memorial Fund was set up in memory of Anita, Alex and Annabel Nicholson, who tragically passed in the Sri Lanka bombing in 2019.  Ben Nicholson wanted to honour the entire family's love of rugby and raise funds to facilitate the development of rugby and in particular the participation of girls, in countries where this would add the most value in Asia. Incorporated in March 2020, Atlas Foundation Asia is a service and fund raising company that go towards supporting impactful projects in Singapore and the region.Atlas Asia is funded by fundraising events such as sporting events, social events where tickets are sold, along with auctions and the like to raise further funds as well as the sale of merchandise.  While some funding is from donations, this is expected to represent less than half of the revenue of the company.  The company was incorporated in March, just before the Covid-19 pandemic took hold and most of the funds that will be transferred in were collected via Atlas Foundation in the UK and the Singapore Rugby Union who provided facilities for collecting the funds.Projects include the development of rugby and modified forms of rugby for: girls within Singapore and in other Asian countries, for athletes with disabilities (e.g. wheelchair rugby in Singapore) and for less privileged children across Asia (projected in Cambodia and looking at many others).",

What makes this site unique, however, is that it also helps the host get the gift they really want and allows them to support a charity.  The celebrant chooses a gift they hope to receive, and commit to donating between 50% -100% of their monetary gifts to one of the partner charities.  Instead of guests bringing individual gifts to a party, they can give their monetary gift through the site.  Gift-It-Forward pools the contributions and splits the proceeds between the dream gift and charity.  Now that\u2019s something to celebrate!  Not only can this service be used for birthdays, but it can also be used to set up holiday gift and charity funds, housewarming parties, baby showers, and many other occasions.  Now even friends and family from overseas can join in the celebration by contributing to your gift and charity!"

Our Community space operates our core membership which gives access to weekly activities, workshops and field trips which are non-academic in nature. All our programmes are designed to cultivate Character, Collaboration and Communication skills. More importantly, Glyph exists as a safe space to forge valuable relationships which serve as emotional support pillars outside of school and family where many kids or youth tend to struggle.Our Academy develops specialty programmes and curriculum in Technology, Arts, and Life-skills and are designed to foster Computational and Critical Thinking capabilities while building Creative capacities. Above all, the Academy aims to help kids and youth find their strengths through alternative subject areas which they could be passionate in but lack the opportunity or exposure in the first place.Our Fitness platform serves as an inspirational ground for aspiring athletes to develop enduring qualities and a nurturing environment to build sports skills which champions resonate with in their pursuit of sporting excellence. Even if families lack sporting ambitions, Glyph Fitness remains an active advocate of \"Fitness for Life\u201d; we believe fitness is a powerful conduit in developing the traits needed for an individual to be successful later on in life.",

The result is the Safe Water Garden (SWG).The SWG was subsequently recognized by the Indonesian government in early 2020, making it officially the world\u2019s most cost-efficient sanitation system. Its key benefits:- Improves life quality (prevents disease particularly among children)- Positively impacts the global environment (reduced pollution)- Generates 3-10% household-savings, partly by recycling wastewater to power a crop garden- Open source, affordable to all, locally buildable, maintenance-free- It supports 11 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, critically SDG 2, 3, and 6So far deployed in over 500 village households & 14 public schools, the official recognition of the systems in early 2020 prompted lots of private and public interest to participate in the rollout. As such, we now aim for 100 million SWGs worldwide by 2030, through consolidating and extending our current private-public partnerships while exercising quality control of this global operation via our Singapore-based HQ. The goal is that everyone benefits: our partners in the roll-out must find a key role that suits them, while the end-users will get access to universally affordable and life-changing sanitation.",

When there is a medical emergency, villagers in Bangladesh have to wait for more than an hour to get an ambulance. Even after reaching this late, that ambulance would charge beyond a villager's affordability. As a result of our service, these people will now get ambulances that are faster and way cheaper than the existing alternatives.",
            "Products_And_Services": "We provide two services to the rural people of Bangladesh. These are targeted towards the people who have currently no or very little access to emergency healthcare. The first one is the regular ambulance service that is faster and cheaper than existing alternatives. Our second service is doorstep medical service where our trained medical assignment provides in-home treatment to those patients who do not require visiting hospital but needs urgent treatment. In both cases, we charge payment from the villagers. Our third service which is targeted towards the hospital is the \"Monthly ambulance subscription\" package. Over 80% of rural hospitals do not have an ambulance. With a monthly subscription fee, these hospitals can use Safewheel ambulances to serve their patients. Our priority now is to integrate technology into our offerings. We will be exploring more technology integrated services like telemedicine and remote patient monitoring systems in the coming days.The benefits of the tricycle ambulances are: 1/10th the production costs of regular ambulances (only $3500), has medical equipment, certified by expert engineers, backed by the local government division, can reach narrow village roads, and have a trained medical assistant onboard (which is very hard to get in Bangladesh)."

By understanding how multi-sensory cognitive games can potentially delay the decline of the condition, allowing families to have more time with the elderly when they are still lucid.

Many other sensory games in the market focus on the tactility or olfactory aspect without incorporating the various skills (sensory, visual, memory, precision, co-ordination, orientational and creative skills), which can further cognitively stimulate people with dementia. MatchLink follows the needs and can be used for patients at all four Pool Activity Levels (PAL), an instrument that determines the cognitive ability of the people with dementia for activity engagement. The four levels are planned, exploratory, sensory and reflex level. How players will be assessed will be based on a scorecard where points are given based on the number of blocks identified and the intensity of the given set of blocks. Player\u2019s capabilities will be assessed based on the increase in number of points from each game session. Having the scorecard makes it easy for caregivers to keep track of player\u2019s improvement and the skills they are able to use.Other variations incorporating the same elements of multi-sensory stimulation (with the addition of more senses, including the sense of smell, touch, sight and hearing), symbolic familiarity, creativity, social and intergenerational interaction and physical exercise which also can be used in the form of a rehabilitative tool incorporating elements of a more universal theme, nature.Beyond the hardware, we aim to create a digitise platform to create a personalised senior profile for better fitting care, through (i) noting changes in measures and connecting to doctors, (ii) inform of personalised care data to caretakers and (iii) provide recommendations on impact of dementia conditions and intervention solutions to family members."

A report can be generated in real-time to allow the user to understand the condition of their building \u2013 which allows them to configure the setting of the building as necessary. Compared to conventional Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors for smart building, SMALI AI platform with the smart recessed light is much affordable, easy to install and maintain. SMALI AI platform is also an open platform that provides an interface with other systems. SoundEye aimed to build an interconnected system that will enable different solution providers and enterprise to access to the data collected by the smart recessed light. SMALI will contribute to facilities related to elderly and Person With Disability (PWD). SMALI intends to reduce the detection and verification time for emergencies from the original ten minutes to two minutes. Upon receiving an alert of a person screaming for help, this triggers an alarm. The dashboard will allow operators/security guards to playback a short audio clip that triggers the sound alert. The following table shows how sound recognition is much faster than the standard panic button and emergency pull-cord."

Handprint is on a mission to integrate positive impact in every business transaction.By integrating Handprint into core business processes that underpin critical KPIs, companies can truly become climate-positive. We've built tools for online checkouts, are working on offline experiences by integrating proof of impact into physical objects, and are developing new applications every week. Soon you'll be able to integrate positive impact in every ride, stream, ad impression and countless other strategic KPIs.The company was founded under a different name (Greeen Design) in 2019 but turned into Handprint in March 2020, when they really started working on it.",
            "Products_And_Services": "Handprint digitizes positive impact projects and integrate and automate the funding of these projects in strategic businesses transactions. They are unique in the following dimensions (Value):1) They simplify sustainability and put regeneration first: Many companies (with low margin, like SMEs) want to do something good for the world but are held up in a maze of conflicting messages, lack of knowledge, and lack of resources which leads to inaction. They provide curated, top quality projects for them to support. They directly connect company and cause, which reduces cost and creates an impact premium.  2) This support brings marketing and reputational advantages to their clients. 3) They are investigating with some early adopters whether the plugin changes consumer behavior. In e-commerce up to 80% of purchases are stuck in an e-cart and consumers do not check out, leading to lost revenue. With some clients, they are exploring if this number goes down if Handprint is implemented. Consumers would be reminded that their purchase is not only for them but also for the planet.4) Education and awareness: the Handprint Visualize API is a powerful tool to bring awareness to the importance of regenerating the earth and supporting sustainable development5) SDG scope: While many competitors resell off the shelf accredited carbon sequestration projects, their projects stretch all SDGs, which facilitates strategic alignment with corporate purpose. 6) IDEAL MRV^2: Handprint uses remote sensing, blockchain, IOT, mobile, and other digital technologies to ensure Integrated, Digital, Effective, Automated, and Low-cost Monitoring, Reporting, Verification and Visualization (IDEAL MRV^2) of financial and impact data."

            "About Us": "Red Crowns Senior Living provides live-in care for elderly aged 55 and above to age-in-place. Our elder care model provides live-in care in HDB flats, condominium apartments, and landed houses. Unlike nursing homes and old folks\u2019 homes which provide age-in-institution care model, Red Crowns Senior Living homes are more homely, offer more freedom and autonomy. According to research by Lien Foundation, over 90% of elderly prefer to age-in-place and not age-in-institution.  Red Crowns Senior Living provides three categories of homes, namely Independent Living, Assisted Living, and Memory Care. These are for elderlies who are looking for somewhere to live long-term.Independent living homes are suitable for elderly who requires little or no assistance. They prefer to live in a community with other elderly and not live alone. Professional nursing care and assistance is available when required. Assisted living homes are suitable for elderly who require assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs). Our assisted living homes provide 24/7 supervision, medication management and medical escorts, assistance with ADLs, and household chores and laundry by our live-in caregivers.Memory care homes are for elderly who are diagnosed with early to mid-stage dementia or Parkinson\u2019s Disease. The social engagement and memory care programs provided by Red Crowns Senior Living delay the mental and cognitive deterioration of elderly with dementia.   Red Crowns Senior Living hopes to offer viable elder care options for elderly in a rapidly ageing Singapore. Currently, there are limited care options besides the solutions of nursing homes and old folk\u2019s homes. Stay at home option may not be suitable for some. Waiting time for placement at such elder care institutions is long; often takes up to a few months to a year. Currently Red Crowns Senior Living has about 40 to 50 elderly in waiting list hoping to get into one of our 6 homes in various part of Singapore. We are hoping to scale up fast to serve a larger population of Singaporeans through various means. One of the mean includes utilizing technology to improve our operations efficiencies and in turn, to raise our productivity. Another mean is to improve the quality of our elder care through our cloud-based care management application.",

            "About Us": "The Food Gardens. A group of dedicated people finding ways to grow food in any urban spaces they can find. Food is lots of edibles in predictable quality, quantity and time. Garden describe the size we operate in and the plural reflects our aim to spread what we learn so that more spaces within the urban context can grow more food, for ourselves and those that need but can\u2019t.We are almost 4 years old. We have grown close to 4,000kg of leafy vegetables, much more if you count the fruited vegetables we have grown in these years, and the other community sites we have assisted with knowledge, seedlings and, sometimes, direct work. If there is only one thing we have shown and learnt over the 4 years is that given any suitable spaces, apply a suitable farming method, one can produce a significant amount of food in the urban area. Leafy vegetables, our main focus, produce the highest yields in any space and take the least time. While the amount achieved would satisfy the typical gardener, the potential that this plot has shown encourages us to further dream of serving the community. But to make an impact on the community who needs but can\u2019t grow their own, we need to do more. A lot more. We sincerely think that growing quality food is a better solution than, say, dumpster diving. However well intentioned, the quality of donated items can be suspect at times. Kudos to the volunteers that have to sieve through it. What started as a couple\u2019s dream is now a team, with more wanting to join. We have the knowledge and experience that is closer to the professional farmers. We like to do more.But the food we grow has a direct linear relationship with land. The Food Gardens @ 11 Jalan Ubi is an inherited space which could be further optimised. We have grown the plantable areas significantly but there is a limit. Further, urban spaces are subject to alternate use over time. At the same time, we see a lot of underused spaces within the city that can be used to grow food. Any plot with 6 hours of sun exposure will fit the bill. School compounds, present and repurposed, top floor of multi-storey car parks, flat roof tops in buildings, just to name a few. Sometimes, existing gardens are not optimized. We had helped a few and the transformation is obvious. We now seek partners who can provide us a larger space, hopefully on a longer duration, to continue our work. With a larger space, we will need assistance in financing for it will be beyond our current ability to support out of our pockets. The alternative is to collect a network of spaces supported by a center that provides planning, seedling, manpower allocation and such. We have done some experiments with this model and the results are encouraging. This could integrate with other efforts abound. The farms in Lim Chu Kang can produce somewhere between 500-1000+kg per day. This will satisfy the daily needs of an organization like Willing Hearts Soup Kitchen. We do not think that we will have the kind of dedicated resources (7-10 people in the sun, daily, whole day!) to achieve the same. We envisage a more gradual growth path with a smaller, space limiting, expectations.Yet, it should be sufficient to make an impact. It would be preferable and conceivable to progress from the present 100+kg a month, to weekly and eventually daily. We are achieving around 2.5kg of harvest per square meter. Of course, this need to be assessed in the new plot  If this average holds, a 100kg harvest will require a plantable space of around 40 square meter plus (given our amatuer status). Plantable spaces are where soil meets plants, not including access. Over 30 days (this could translate to an area of 1,200-1,500 square meter or more), plus work area, seedling area, and storage areas. Education and community planting plots will probably need a bigger access area. Besides leafy vegetables, we could grow some fruited vegetables, if the space allowed. This is not often found in local farms but it will add varieties. Currently, we are using these to reward the volunteers. They do take up more space and a longer time to harvest.The bottom line is that we want a chance to grow more food for the community who need them. In predictable quality, quantity and time. Hopefully, our intent and track record is sufficient to solicit your assistance in this journey. Let\u2019s grow more food.",

This can be best instilled in the formative years between 3 and 13 when the brain has the maximum flexibility to adapt and learn. However, learning is a journey that must continue life-long.We believe that such skilled master teachers are the biggest asset classrooms and students could have to ensure success in learning to learn, but also that lack of access to such master teachers is a solvable societal challenge. This is what we seek to accomplish in our lifetime and beyond.",
